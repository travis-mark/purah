#  Purah

An API explorer for various Apple frameworks wrapped up as a single app styled as the menu on the Purah Pad from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

## Open Items

All items are prefixed TODO with a colon (for ripgrepping). Items that don't fix a file go here.

- TODO: Try a different (outside-in?) gradient on app icon
- TODO: Get Tears of the Kingdom UI shots for quick reference
